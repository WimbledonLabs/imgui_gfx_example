Imgui / GFX Example
===================

![](https://github.com/WimbledonLabs/imgui_gfx_example/raw/master/resources/example.png)

The mashup of two tutorials that no-one asked for. `unwrap`'s galore! Zero
comments! Questionable commit messages! And more!

Experience for yourself the exciting combination of [the LearningGfx tutorial](https://wiki.alopex.li/LearningGfx), [the `support_gfx` example in imgui-rs](https://github.com/Gekkio/imgui-rs/blob/f7ffac7c8d4abb14896dbae4c02f44205a465ff8/imgui-examples/examples/support_gfx/mod.rs),
and the great divergence of time!

All this, and hopefully it's cross-platform too!
